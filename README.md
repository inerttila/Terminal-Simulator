# Hacker Terminal Simulator

This project simulates a hacker-style terminal with code appearing character by character.

## Description

The project consists of an HTML page and JavaScript code that creates a hacker-like terminal effect. When you open the HTML page, it will display a black screen with green text, and the code will appear as if it's being typed by a hacker.
